<!--The SQL Map can have a single <properties> element that allows a standard Java properties file
(name=value) to be associated with the SQL Map XML configuration document. By doing so, each named
value in the properties file can become a variable that can be referred to in the SQL Map configuration file
and all Data Mapper referenced within. For example, if the properties file contains the following:
<br><br>
driver=org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
<br><br>
Then the SQL Map configuration file or each SQL Map referenced by the configuration document can use
the placeholder ${driver} as a value that will be replaced by org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver. For example:
<br><br>
&lt;property name="JDBC.Driver" value="${driver}"/&gt;
<br><br>
This comes in handy during building, testing and deployment. It makes it easy to reconfigure your app for
multiple environments or use automated tools for configuration (e.g. Ant). The properties can be loaded
from the classpath (use the resource attribute) or from any valid URL (use the url attribute).-->

<!--The <transactionManager> element allows you to configure the transaction management services for an
SQL Map. The type attribute indicates which transaction manager to use. The value can either be a class
name or a type alias. The three transaction managers included with the framework are: JDBC, JTA and
EXTERNAL.
<br><br>
JDBC - This allows JDBC to control the transaction via the usual Connection commit() and
rollback() methods.<br>
JTA - This transaction manager uses a JTA global transaction such that the SQL Map activities can
be included as part of a wider scope transaction that possibly involves other databases or
transactional resources. This configuration requires a UserTransaction property set to locate the
user transaction from a JNDI resource.<br> 
EXTERNAL – This allows you to manage transactions on your own. You can still configure a
data source, but transactions will not be committed or rolled back as part of the framework
lifecycle. This means that some part of your application external to Data Mapper must manage the
transactions. This setting is also useful for non-transactional databases (e.g. Read-only).<br>
<br>
The &lt;transactionManager&gt; element also allows an optional attribute commitRequired that can be true or
false. Normally iBATIS will not commit transactions unless an insert, update, or delete operation has been
performed. This is true even if you explicitly call the commitTransaction() method. This behavior
creates problems in some cases. If you want iBATIS to always commit transactions, even if no insert,
update, or delete operation has been performed, then set the value of the commitRequired attribute to true.
Examples of where this attribute is useful include:
<br><br>
1. If you call a stored procedures that updates data as well as returning rows. In that case you would
call the procedure with the queryForList() operation – so iBATIS would not normally commit the
transaction. But then the updates would be rolled back.<br>
2. In a WebSphere environment when you are using connection pooling and you use the JNDI
<dataSource> and the JDBC or JTA transaction manager. WebSphere requires all transactions on
pooled connections to be committed or the connection will not be returned to the pool.<br>
<br>
Note that the commitRequired attribute has no effect when using the EXTERNAL transaction manager.
<br><br>
Some of the transaction managers allow extra configuration properties.-->

<!--Included as part of the transaction manager configuration is a dataSource element and a set of properties to
configure a DataSource for use with your SQL Map. There are currently three datasource factories
provided with the framework, but you can also write your own.
<br><br>
<b>SimpleDataSourceFactory</b><br>
The SimpleDataSource factory provides a basic implementation of a pooling DataSource that is
ideal for providing connections in cases where there is no container provided DataSource. It is
based on the iBATIS SimpleDataSource connection pool implementation.
<br><br>
<b>DbcpDataSourceFactory</b><br>
This implementation uses Jakarta DBCP (Database Connection Pool) to provide connection
pooling services via the DataSource API. This DataSource is ideal where the application/web
container cannot provide a DataSource implementation, or you’re running a standalone
application. IBATIS provides direct access to setting the properties of a DBCP datasource by
allowing you to specify any DBCP property name you desire in the configuration.
<br><br>
<b>JndiDataSourceFactory</b><br>
This implementation will retrieve a DataSource implementation from a JNDI context from within
an application container. This is typically used when an application server is in use and a
container managed connection pool and associated DataSource implementation are provided. The
standard way to access a JDBC DataSource implementation is via a JNDI context.
JndiDataSourceFactory provides functionality to access such a DataSource via JNDI. The
configuration parameters that must be specified in the datasource stanza are as follows:
<br><br>
&lt;transactionManager type="JDBC" &gt;<br>
	&lt;dataSource type="JNDI"&gt;<br>
		&lt;property name="DataSource" value="java:comp/env/jdbc/jpetstore"/&gt;<br>
	&lt;/dataSource&gt;<br>
&lt;/transactionManager&gt;<br>
<br>
The above configuration will use normal JDBC transaction management. But with a container
managed resource, you might also want to configure it for global transactions as follows:
<br><br>
&lt;transactionManager type="JTA" &gt;<br>
	&lt;property name="UserTransaction" value="java:/comp/UserTransaction"/&gt;<br>
	&lt;dataSource type="JNDI"&gt;<br>
		&lt;property name="DataSource" value="java:comp/env/jdbc/jpetstore"/&gt;<br>
	&lt;/dataSource&gt;<br>
&lt;/transactionManager&gt;<br>
<br>
Notice the UserTransaction property that points to the JNDI location where the UserTransaction
instance can be found. This is required for JTA transaction management so that your SQL Map
take part in a wider scoped transaction involving other databases and transactional resources.
JNDI context properties can be added before the lookup by specifying additional properties with a
prefix of "context.".-->

<!--The resultObjectFactory element allows you to specify a factory class for creating objects resulting from
the execution of SQL statements. This element is optional – if you don't specify the element, iBATIS will
use internal mechanisms to create result objects (class.newInstance()).
<br><br>
iBATIS creates result objects in these cases:
<br>
1. When mapping rows returned from a ResultSet (the most common case)<br>
2. When you use a nested select statement on a result element in a resultMap. If the nested select
statement declares a parameterClass, then iBATIS will create and populate an instance of the class
before executing the nested select<br>
3. When executing stored procedures – iBATIS will create objects for OUTPUT parameters<br>
4. When processing nested result maps. If the nested result map is used in conjunction with the
groupBy support for avoiding N+1 queries, then the object will typically be an implementation of
type Collection, List, or Set. You can provide custom implementations of these interfaces through
the result object factory if you wish. In a 1:1 join with a nested result map, then iBATIS will
create an instance of the specified domain object through this factory.<br>
<br>
If you choose to implement a factory, your factory class must implement the interface
com.ibatis.sqlmap.engine.mapping.result.ResultObjectFactory, and your class must have a public
default constructor. The ResultObjectFactory interface has two-->
